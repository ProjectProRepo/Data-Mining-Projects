# Movie Recommendation System

This project demonstrates how to build a **Movie Recommendation System** using the popular MovieLens dataset. The system applies **data mining techniques** and **recommendation algorithms** to suggest movies based on user preferences.

---

## Project Objectives
- Explore and analyze movie rating data.
- Visualize trends such as genre popularity, rating distribution, and user behavior.
- Build different recommendation models:
  - **Content-Based Filtering** (based on genres and metadata)
  - **Collaborative Filtering** (using user-item rating matrix)
  - **Hybrid Models** combining both.
- Evaluate system performance and interpret results.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)
- **Files include:**
  - `movies_metadata.csv` â†’ Movie information (title, genres, release year, etc.)
  - `ratings.csv` â†’ User ratings (userId, movieId, rating, timestamp)
  - `links.csv`, `credits.csv`, `keywords.csv` â†’ Additional metadata (optional)

---

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` â†’ Data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` â†’ Data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` â†’ Machine learning utilities  
  - `surprise` (optional) â†’ Recommender system algorithms  

---

## Data Mining
- Distribution of movie ratings  
- Average rating per genre  
- Popularity vs average rating scatterplot  
- Sparsity visualization of the userâ€“movie matrix  

---

## Recommendation Approaches
1. **Content-Based Filtering**  
   - Uses movie features like genres to recommend similar titles.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**  
   - Based on similarities between users or movies in the rating matrix.  
   - Techniques include Cosine Similarity, Matrix Factorization, etc.

3. **Hybrid System**  
   - Combines both approaches for more accurate suggestions.

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Outcomes
- Gain insights into user behavior and movie preferences.
- Build hands-on experience with data mining in recommendation systems.
- Learn how platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime personalize content.
