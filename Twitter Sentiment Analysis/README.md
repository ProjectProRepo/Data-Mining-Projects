# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project demonstrates how to perform **Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data** to understand public opinion about a product or brand. The system applies **data mining techniques** and **text classification models** to categorize tweets as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.  

---  

## Project Objectives  
- Collect real-time tweets using `snscrape` (or use Kaggle Twitter datasets).  
- Clean and preprocess tweet text (remove links, mentions, hashtags, and special characters).  
- Perform sentiment analysis using **TextBlob** or deep learning models.  
- Visualize insights such as:  
  - Sentiment distribution (Positive/Negative/Neutral)  
  - Sentiment trends over time  
  - Most popular hashtags and keywords  
  - Hourly/weekly sentiment shifts  
- Understand how businesses can use social media mining for decision-making.

## Dataset  
- **Source Options:**  
  - Real-time tweets scraped using ['TweePy`](https://www.tweepy.org/)  
---  

## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` â†’ Data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` â†’ Data visualization  
  - `re` â†’ Text preprocessing  
  - `textblob` â†’ Rule-based sentiment analysis  
  - `scikit-learn` / `transformers` (optional) â†’ Machine learning and NLP models  

---  

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Sentiment distribution (bar chart, pie chart)  
- Hourly or daily sentiment trend (line chart)  
- Top hashtags used in tweets (bar chart)  
- Word clouds for Positive, Negative, Neutral tweets  

---  

## Sentiment Analysis Approaches  
1. **Rule-based Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Using `TextBlob` polarity scores to classify tweets.  
2. **Machine Learning Approach (Optional)**  
   - Use bag-of-words or TF-IDF features with Logistic Regression / Random Forest.  
3. **Deep Learning Approach (Optional)**  
   - Apply pre-trained transformer models like **BERT** for better accuracy.

## Expected Outcomes  
- Understand public opinion about a product, brand, or event from Twitter data.  
- Gain hands-on experience with **data mining and text classification**.  
- Learn how industries leverage **social media sentiment analysis** for marketing and reputation management.
